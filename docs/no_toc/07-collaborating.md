# Collaborating

Collaborating on Overleaf is much more doable if you have access to a [paid plan](https://www.overleaf.com/user/subscription/plans). If you have a collaborator who has a paid plan, then you will have access to the features that are part of their plan. Overleaf may change which of the following features are available for free vs paid accounts.

Share projects for others to view or edit, 3. Open reviewing mode, 4. Add comments to content" width="100%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

## Seeing collaborators

Different users will show up as a square with the first initial of their username if collaborators are also working on the same file.

## Sharing

You can share a project with a collaborator (or with the world) similarly to a Google document. Just click on the share button and specify how you want people to access your project.

## Submitting

When you are ready to submit a document to a publisher, like a preprint to arXiv, you can do so using the `submit` button.

You can send general messages using the "Chat" button.

## Review mode

If you press the "review" button, which is to the right of the "share" button, you can enable certain reviewing features.

You will see a gray column open to the right of the source editor. Here you can add comments and toggle on and off the tracking of changes.

### Adding comments

You can also write comments about specific text by highlighting the text in review mode (by first pressing the review button) and then clicking "add comment".

Comments need to be verified to be posted. They can then be edited, resolved, or responded to.

Resolved comments can be found at the top left button in the review panel when in review mode.
